# Getting Started

This guide includes setup, configuration, and basic development steps.

## Setup

You will want to follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app/writing-web-service)
and:

 - create a Google Cloud Project, you can request one at Stanford [here](https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=fa9f80bddbf05b401df130cf9d96198b)
 - install the gcloud command line client and Python3+
 - authenticate on the command line with `gcloud auth application-default login`

For example, after I've created my project and I've installed gcloud, I might login and
then set the default project to be my new project:

```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
$ gcloud config set project <myproject>
```

## Config

In the [config.py](config.py) file, you can define as many or
as few of the custom variables (e.g., a Twitter alias) as you like. These are
rendered in various pages by default. You can also choose to disable authentication
with `disable_auth = True`.

## Development

To develop locally, you'll want to create a local environment and then install
dependencies to it.

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install  -r requirements.txt
```

Then you will want to copy the .example-env file to .env, populate it with your secrets,
and source it:

```bash
source .env
```

And then to run the application locally, issue this command:

```bash
python main.py
```

And then you can open up your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
The main index view is a small portal to direct you to views and features available.

## Testing

A set of example tests are provided in [test_gcpflask.py](https://github.com/stanford-rc/gcp-flask-stanford/blob/master/test_gcpflask.py), and you can read more about testing in flask [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/testing/). You can run local testing with pytest as follows:

```bash
pytest -sv test_gcpflask.py
```

## Deployment

When you are ready to deploy to app engine, first make sure that you are again
authenticated to use the correct project:

```bash
$ gcloud auth application-default login
$ gcloud config set project <myproject>
```

You'll first want to enable app engine, and you'll need to choose a zone. If you get a permission
denied error, add permissions for app engine to the username associated with your account on the [Google Cloud Interface](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam). When permissions are correct, the following commands will work.

```bash
$ gcloud app create --project=srcc-dinosaur-dev
```

When you are ready, deploy your app!

```bash
$ gcloud app deploy
Initializing App Engine resources...done.                                                                                                
Services to deploy:

descriptor:      [/home/vanessa/Desktop/Code/gcp-flask-stanford/app.yaml]
source:          [/home/vanessa/Desktop/Code/gcp-flask-stanford]
target project:  [srcc-dinosaur-dev]
target service:  [default]
target version:  [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
target url:      [https://srcc-dinosaur-dev.uc.r.appspot.com]

Deployed service [default] to [https://srcc-dinosaur-dev.uc.r.appspot.com]

You can stream logs from the command line by running:
  $ gcloud app logs tail -s default

To view your application in the web browser run:
  $ gcloud app browse
```

In the above we see:

 - a confirmation of app metadata
 - files uploaded to Google Storage
 - the final deployed URL.
 - commands to show logs, or open to the url (browse).

Note that the .gcloudignore file is important to not upload your docs, Python environment,
or other metadata or secrets. Speaking of environment variables, if you need them you can
add them to your [app.yml file](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/appref). 
Indeed, if you needed to write all of these functions (e.g., build a container, have static
files uploaded to storage, etc.) it would have been very cumbersome. But this deployment
is in fact incredibly easy! App Engine is great because you pay for what you use, and
the base containers are maintained for you. And a few final tips:

 - if you need to re-do the storage upload, you can delete the buckets entirely (both for staging and production) and they will be re-generated.

## Cleaning Up

You should navigate to App Engine --> Settings and then click on "Disable Application" to permanently disable it.
Cleaning up also then means:

 - deleting the production and staging storage buckets for your app
 - deleting the storage artifacts bucket (e.g., logs) if they are not needed.


## Next Steps

By default, the database (sqlite) won't work on app engine because it's a read only file
system. [Google Cloud Managed SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql) is an option, however it's expensive (typically $55 a month)
and so you might consider requesting [Stanford Managed SQL](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sql)
instead. You would then export the `FLASKAPP_DATABASE` in your local .env file for local testing and
development (e.g., you would likely want to test/create the database before deployment):

```bash
# This is the default
export FLASKAPP_DATABASE=sqlite

# MySql and Postgres
export FLASKAPP_DATABASE=mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>/<database-name>
export FLASKAPP_DATABASE=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:5432/<database-name>
```

More details on writing database strings for sqlalchemy are [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). 
And then also add the environment variable in your app.yml which **must not be added to a public
GitHub repository, or even a private one for that matter!**
