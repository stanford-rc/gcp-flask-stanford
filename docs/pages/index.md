> Welcome to the gcp-flask-stanford Documentation base!

This is the first of many templates that takes the opinion that it shouldn't be a lot
of work to deploy an application to show off your analysis, paper, or even to
create a programmatic RestFul API for others to use. Brought to you by [Research Software Engineering Services](https://stanford-rc.github.io/rse-services), this is the first of several free-to-use templates that will get you started with a solid base for your development.
If you have any requests for features or questions, please don't hesitate
to [open an issue](https://www.github.com/stanford-rc/gcp-flask-template/issues).
